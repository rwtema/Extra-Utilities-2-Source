Note on Logs:
    Crash logs are not gone once you close the window, they are recorded as text files in the "crash reports" folder, which is found alongside the "mods" and "config" folders.
    For non-crashing issues, you can provide the "debug.log" file found in the "logs" folder, note that debug.log *is* replaced every time you launch the game, unless you prefer sorting through the other log files.

Note on Origin:
